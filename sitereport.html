        the seasion by watching the recorded video and reading through the slides the following week. the assignment was quite

      <p>Programming has many faces. It is the science of structured thinking. It is the art of eloquent expression.
         It teaches you to be humble when you look at other peoples' fascinating work. Most of all, it teaches you a
          lot about yourself. While the syntax may change, the concepts will not.
          <p>If you're not sure yet whether you want to learn how to program, this blog is for you.</p>
